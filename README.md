In chip design, the routing problem involves finding paths to connect circuit
components on a chip while avoiding obstacles. Leeâ€™s Algorithm is a classic
method for routing on a grid, and it guarantees a shortest path.
Design a program to find the shortest path on a 2D grid (M by N) from a
starting point (source) to an endpoint (sink) while avoiding all obstacles (blocks).
